# liri-hw

This program is designed to allow a user to look up information on multiple types of entertainment web apps in one query. By typing in 
"node liri.js" and then one of 4 commands followed by the name of the entertainment they want to look up, in one place a user cand find information about upcoming concerts by their favorite band, information on a song, information on a movie, or take developer provided commands and run them.```

User should cd into the folder called liri-node-app. at this point user should do a node install 
Upon completion, user should enter into the console the following, separated by spaces 
* position 0- node
* position 1- liri.app
* position 2- (choose one of the following commands:
  * concert-this  <this will give you local concert information based on a band/artist name>
  * spotify-this-song   <this will give you spotify information for a song name>
  * movie-this    <this will give you information on a movie name of your choice>
  * do-what-it-says*  <this is a portal to a random text file which contain developers' choice command and variable>
* position 3- (user free input--varies depending on command)
  * for 'concert-this', enter a band/artist name
  * for 'spotify-this-song' enter a song name
  * for movie-this enter a movie name of your choice
  * for do-what-it-says enter nothing--this is completely out of your hands and entirely a developer vanity IMHO and provides no value to user.









(e.g. node liri.js concert-this Gorillaz).
